### Intro

This is the front-end part of my Unit 4 food tracker app. Originally built for my wife, the goal of the app is to allow users to quickly input meal information to track patterns with foods that may make them sick. This continues to be a work in progress but the majority of the basic functionality is there. As users input data, a chart dynamically updates with top triggers and emojis are placed inline with food items for more visual queues. 

### Challenges
This was my first project diving into React on this scale. Leared alot with handling props/state as well as setting state. With auth, initially was hard to manage 'logged in' state.

### Technologies
The bulk of the front end is built with React. Other tools were used such as React Router, React Context, and ChartJS.  The majority of the styling was done with Materialize and remains a work in progress

### Next steps
Finish styling. Finish user experience. Finish full auth experience. Refactor :) (functionality was forced in to certain parts of the code)
