### Intro

This is the front-end part of my Unit 4 food tracker app. Originally built for my wife, the goal of the app is to allow users to quickly input meal information to track patterns with foods that may make them sick. This continues to be a work in progress but the majority of the basic functionality is there. As users input data, a chart dynamically updates with top triggers and emojis are placed inline with food items for more visual queues. 

### Challenges
Coming into this project one thing I wanted to do was make a full authentication system. I'd say I made in 80% of the way there and had a path to finish but due to time constraints and my desire to implement React Native, I decided to put pieces of this on hold. For example. Password reset is available, however, the password is not sent via email and is also reset immediately. Second, the password update function is also available and functioning, however no extra authentication is required, so any logged in user can change their password. Finally a ton of error checking happens but isn't apparent to the user. 

### Technologies
The bulk of the front end is built with React. A other tools were used such as React Router, React Context, and ChartJS.  The majority of the styling was done with Materialize and remains a work in progress

### Next steps
Finish styling. Finish user experience. Finish full auth experience. Refactor :) (functionality was forced in to certain parts of the code)
